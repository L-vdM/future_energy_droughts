## Data availability

The underlying simulation data is available via [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/15342193). It contains daily renewable energy production and temperature-dependent demand data for multiple European regions under present-day and future climate scenarios, derived from the KNMI-LENTIS 1600-year large ensemble dataset.
